These are OS-Railway (fully printable railway system) new track turnouts modifyied to add SG90 mini servo controll.

Tips:

1. For lever model i strongly advice to print with 0.1mm layer height because of servo connector (if connector still does not make a good contact with servo you can you can try to increase extrusion a bit or even put a tiny piece of paper between connector and servo. The rest can be printed with standard 0.2mm layer height.
2. Servo cover is same for left and right turnout. I suggest to print it upside down with support.
3. Servo turn angle needed is only around 60* SO BE CAREFOUL how far You turn the servo, or You can break it.
4. Use silicone/PTFE grease to make the mechaninal parts move smoothly and prolong their life.
5. If it comes to mechanism cover screws, you need M1.4mm screws 6mm long. You can use shorter screws if You drill the cover screw holes with 2.5mm drill to make screw heads covered.
6. For servo mount, You can Youe M2x6mm screws.

Its my first contact with 3d modeling, i am aware it is not perfect but i can guarantee it does work.
